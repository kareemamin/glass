       Life is meant to be explored.
       Places are meant to be discovered.
       
       Tour is the application we would make #ifihadglass
       
       
        The places we move through in our day to day lives are filled
        with rich history and stories. If we had Google Glass we would
        let you experience, discover, and really understand your surroundings
        and the world around you. We'd aim to connect you to the place you
        go in a way that's never been possible before.
